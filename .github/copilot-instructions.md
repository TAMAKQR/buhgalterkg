 - [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. (Created file with required checklist.)

 - [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Next.js + PostgreSQL on Render, browser-based UI.)

 - [x] Customize the Project (Added Prisma schema, Telegram auth flow, admin & manager UI, and API routes.)

 - [x] Install Required Extensions (No additional VS Code extensions were necessary.)

 - [x] Compile the Project (Installed deps, ran `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.)

 - [x] Create and Run Task (No VS Code tasks required for this workflow.)

 - [ ] Launch the Project (Awaiting user confirmation before starting dev server.)

 - [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README.md + .env.example updated; removed stale instructions.)

 - Work through each checklist item systematically.
 - Keep communication concise and focused.
 - Follow development best practices.
